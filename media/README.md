This is a potential revamp of the website for a small business of a family member. 

Made with:
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) JavaScript
4) CSS Grid

It was not very challenging for me, as I have done a few projects like this. Although at this point, it is always a bit of a headache when I use CSS grids. Certainly getting more and more proficient with each project though, which is encouraging.

I haven't added any kind of responsiveness to the page yet, and could defiantly vamp up the accessability. The function of this page was more to show off some design to the client. I know that there are more efficient was to brainstorm UX design, but New Zealand just went back into lock-down, so it's not like I have anything better to do.
